```


Load main data related to companies cost structure
Data is formated in a very interesting way so I expect a lot of work to make it 
tidy

```{r}
data <- read_xlsx(path = here("Raw Data",
                              "Costs structure 2012-2019  +.xlsx"),
                  na = c("к/с", "−"), skip = 5, trim_ws = TRUE
                  )

```

Have to rename colnames manually

```{r}
data %>% 
  col
```
